# FlyingBear Ghost 5 enclosure: top cover and front cover/door

Finally I decided to buy another 3D printer, this time I choose the FlyingBear Gost 5. I buy it because for 250 â‚¬ it has solved many problems of other printers like Ender or Artillery (with the same price).

I made a case because I would like to print a more dangerous material like ABS, and to do that I create two different rears of the top cover, one standard and one with a fan for extracting harmful fumes.
